<h2>MySQL Installation Procedure on Windows </h2>

Go to https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/installer/ , You will find two files.

The <a href="https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/file/?id=471660"> first</a> one is the web version which will download the required files from the internet during the installation and the<a href="https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/file/?id=471661"> second </a> one will install the MySQL Server directly. That is why there is a dramatic difference in the size of the two files. 

Download the file as per you conveniences and run it.

Choose the Setup Type, I recommend you to go for "Server only" if you just want to install MySQL Server. 
You can select any type as per your needs.
