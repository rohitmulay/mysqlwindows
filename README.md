<h2>MySQL Installation Procedure on Windows </h2>

Go to https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/installer/ , you will find two files.

The <a href="https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/file/?id=471660"> first </a> one is the web version which will download the required files from the internet during the installation and the <a href="https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/file/?id=471661"> second </a>  one will install the MySQL Server directly. That is why there is a dramatic difference in the size of the two files. 

Download the file as per you conveniences and run it.

Choose the Setup Type, I recommend you to go for "Server only" if you just want to install MySQL Server. 
You can select any type as per your needs.

You have now successfully completed the installation procedure of MySQL.

To run your MySQL Server go to "Start" on your taskbar, you will find a command prompt icon with the name "MySQL 5.7 Command Line Client"
double click on it.

A black screen window will open, that is nothing but the command promt window and it will ask you to "Enter password:".
Enter the password what you set while installation (root123) and press "Enter".
